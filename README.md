<img src=./todolist.png>

## Description:
<p> Add to the list by typing in the box. <br> Remove items from the list by clicking on them. </p>

## How to Run:
<p> Clone all files to a single folder. <br> Open a local browser and then index.html file.</p>

## Future Improvements:
<p> I plan to add a "Completed" section where the completed items will appear. </p>
